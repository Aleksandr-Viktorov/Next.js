_Hollow-Knight_ is a challenging and artful insect-based adventure. As a cute little bug, you go up against deadly creatures and intricate traps while unraveling the mysteries in fungal wastes, bone temples, and ruined “gothic-like” underground cities.

Buying maps along the way, you wield the Knight’s nail, a sword-like weapon, to keep enemies and bosses at bay.
